                    Dr. Turney
                    Pradeep Kumara pointed out that regardless of the warnings, certain people had resorted to visiting

                    beaches and collecting debris, at times accompanied by children as well.</p>

                    Squad on the directions of General Shavendra Silva, Chief of Defence Staff and Commander of the Army
                    on Thursday (27) were positioned along Negombo to Porutota coastal belt areas of about 6 km, in an
                    attempt to prevent people from collecting debris and floating items of the ill-fated container ship,
                    â€˜X-press Pearlâ€™ container ship, still on fire off Colombo Harbour.<br><br>As reports reaching
                    Colombo and the Police confirmed that pockets of people along the north-western coastal belt are
                    engaged in collecting toxic debris and floating items of the container ship, gutted by the chemical
                    explosion on board, the Army HQ was requested to provide additional troops to help the Police for
                    dispersal of those people who were reportedly collecting remnants which are chemically polluted,
                    poisonous, and not fit for human consumption.<br><br>General Shavendra Silva accordingly directed
                    the Commander, Security Forces-West Major General Vikum Liyanage to immediately deploy necessary
                    troop contingencies along the coastal belt to help the Police to avert recurrence of movements of
                    the general public while COVID-19 travel restrictions are in force, and explore possibilities of
                    mitigating the coastal pollution impact and environmental hazards.<br><br>The Singaporean container
                    ship carrying 25 tonnes of nitric acid from India to Singapore caught fire off north of Colombo
                    Harbour on 25 May 2021, but all attempts to bring the blazing fire under control failed as
                    explosions inside those cargo containers continued to flare up.<br><br>However, ship crew members,
                    two of them slightly injured, had to abandon the vessel and were subsequently evacuated by Sri
                    Lankan emergency teams and troops.<br><br>Commander, Security Forces-West Major General Vikum
